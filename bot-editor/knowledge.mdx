# ðŸ“š Knowledge

The **Knowledge** tab is where you give your bot the information it needs to provide meaningful answers.

## Adding knowledge sources
You can upload or link:

- **Files** â€” PDFs, Word documents, plain text, and more
- **URLs** â€” pages that the bot can reference as knowledge

Once added, the bot will reference this content when answering questions, following the AI setup and tone you've defined.

<Info title="Private & Secure">
    Uploaded materials are encrypted and only accessible to you and your bot. No one else can view or use them.
</Info>

<Tip title="Use relevant content">
    The more focused and relevant your knowledge sources, the better your botâ€™s answers will be. Upload lesson notes, study guides, or course readings.
</Tip>

You can remove or replace files and URLs at any time.
