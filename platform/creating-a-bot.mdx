# ðŸ¤– Creating a Bot

Once you've created a project, you can start adding bots to it. Bots are the interactive assistants your students or users will engage with.

## Creating a new bot

1. Open the project where you want the bot to live
2. Click the **New Bot** button
3. Youâ€™ll be given two options:
- **Choose a template** like Quizbot, Research Assistant, or Code Tutor
- **Start from scratch** with a blank configuration
4. Enter a name for your bot
5. Click **Create Bot** to begin customizing it

<Info title="Templates vs. Scratch">
    Templates come with predefined AI roles and behavior tailored to educational use cases. Starting from scratch gives you complete control.

Once your bot is created, you'll be redirected to the **Bot Editor**, where you can define its tone, behavior, knowledge, and more.
