# ðŸ§­ Dashboard Overview

Once logged in, the **Assignbots dashboard** becomes your command center.

Youâ€™ll see an overview of your existing projects, each containing one or more bots. The dashboard helps you:

- Navigate between projects
- Create new bots
- Edit existing bots
- Access account settings

On the left-hand sidebar, youâ€™ll find:

- A button to **create a new project**
- A list of all your saved projects
- Access to **Account Settings**
- An option to **Delete your account and all data**

<Info title="Private & Secure">
    Every project and bot is visible only to you. Each user has an isolated workspace, and all data is encrypted in AWS-hosted infrastructure.

Use the dashboard as your launchpad â€” itâ€™s where all your educational bot-building happens!
